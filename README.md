# roust

**Recall-first code retrieval for coding agents.**

Point an agent at grep and it has to iterate on search terms, reading through
a lot of matches to find what it needs. Point it at roust and it gets a
single, ranked, token-budgeted bundle of the relevant code back in one call,
with no embeddings, no LLM calls, no API keys, and no training. Validated on
407 held-out SWE-bench Verified instances (92.1% all-gold-files, never tuned
on) and on the archex head-to-head benchmark (40/40 tasks at recall 1.00).
roust is a ranking-and-packing pipeline over plain lexical, structural, and
version-control signals — it reads like a very disciplined `grep` session,
compressed into one process call.

## Install

roust is a single Rust binary. Every install path below builds or ships the
same `roust-rs` engine — there is no separate Python implementation.

```bash
# PyPI (wheel built by maturin, bundles the Rust binary):
pip install roust
# or
uv tool install roust
# or
pipx install roust
```

```bash
# From source, via cargo:
cargo install --path roust-rs
```

```bash
# From source, via pip (builds the wheel locally with maturin):
git clone https://github.com/narehart/roust && cd roust && pip install .
```

`git` should be on `PATH` if you want the commit-history signal (roust
degrades gracefully without it).

Developing against `roust-rs/`: `uv run roust` does not rebuild automatically
when `roust-rs/src` changes -- after any Rust edit, run `uv sync
--reinstall-package roust` before relying on `uv run roust` again (`roust
--version` embeds a git SHA + dirty flag so a stale build is identifiable;
see `lab/tokenbench/README.md`'s engine-provenance guard for the automated
version of this check).

The first `roust` call against a repo builds an index — a few hundred
milliseconds to a few seconds depending on repo size. The index is cached
under `<repo>/.roust/` (add that directory to your `.gitignore`) and
refreshes automatically whenever indexed files change, so every call after
the first is a cache hit.

## Usage

```
roust QUERY [PATH]
```

`QUERY` can be a natural-language question or raw issue/error text; `PATH`
defaults to `.`. Default output on stdout is a token-budgeted, packed bundle
of the most relevant code regions; a one-line stats summary always goes to
stderr, so stdout stays clean for piping.

A real session, run against `encode/httpx`:

```bash
$ roust "connection pooling" ~/code/httpx
[... ~8.4k tokens of packed file regions on stdout ...]
roust: 25 files, 8366 tokens (indexed 57 files, index 9ms, query 160ms, cache hit)
```

Other flags:

```bash
# Ranked file paths only, one per line -- for fast localization
roust "connection pooling" ~/code/httpx --files-only

# Machine-readable output: files, packed regions, bundle text, timing stats
roust "connection pooling" ~/code/httpx --json

# Cap the file count (0 = no cap, the default)
roust "connection pooling" ~/code/httpx --k 5

# Change the token budget for the packed bundle (default: 8192)
roust "connection pooling" ~/code/httpx --budget 4096

# Force a fresh index build even if a cache entry exists
roust "connection pooling" ~/code/httpx --reindex

# Skip the on-disk cache entirely (neither reads nor writes .roust/)
roust "connection pooling" ~/code/httpx --no-cache

# Disable individual signal channels (all on by default)
roust "connection pooling" ~/code/httpx --no-history     # git commit-message field + co-change frontier
roust "connection pooling" ~/code/httpx --no-docs        # *.rst/*.txt/*.md docs-bridge
roust "connection pooling" ~/code/httpx --no-anchors     # definition-symbol anchor channel
roust "connection pooling" ~/code/httpx --no-testbridge  # test-file lexical bridge

# Dump the full diagnostic record (roust.core.Explain) as JSON to stderr
roust "connection pooling" ~/code/httpx --explain
```

Exit codes: `0` = results found (this includes low-confidence matches, see
below -- roust still returns its best guess), `1` = no query term matched
anything in the indexed corpus vocabulary at all, `2` = usage error.

### Low-confidence matches

roust always returns a budget-filled bundle for any query that matches at
least one term somewhere in the repo -- it doesn't refuse to answer just
because the match is weak. To make that weak-match case visible instead of
silent, `--json` output's `stats` includes:

- `top_score`: the strongest candidate file's raw (pre-normalization) BM25F
  score for this query -- comparable across queries and repos, unlike the
  0-1 normalized scores used for ranking.
- `matched_query_terms` / `total_query_terms`: how many of the query's terms
  exist anywhere in the indexed corpus vocabulary (body text, comments,
  docs pages, commit messages, or path components).
- `low_confidence: true`, present only when the calibrated criterion trips
  (`top_score` below a fixed threshold, or fewer than 45% of query terms
  found in the corpus vocabulary) -- also appended as `[low-confidence
  match]` to the stderr summary line.

The thresholds were calibrated empirically against all 300 SWE-bench Lite
(query, repo) pairs -- 0 false trips on that real-query population is the
hard constraint -- checked against ~30 gibberish/off-topic queries across 3
repos. Because real BM25F scores scale with query length and repo size,
this signal is calibrated for realistic-size repositories; a tiny
few-file toy repo can legitimately score below the threshold even on a
genuinely on-topic query.

### Output size: agents vs humans

The default `--budget 8192` is sized for LLM context windows, not for a human
scrolling a terminal. A coding agent reads the bundle selectively, and
roust's recall-first packing is measured against that use case: 93.3%
agent-loop solve rate. A human reading the same bundle top-to-bottom will
find it broad by design -- region precision is intentionally traded for
recall, so the bundle covers as many candidate edit sites as fit in the
budget rather than just the single best match.

For hand use, shrink the bundle instead of reading past it:

```bash
# Quarter-size bundle, same latency, best-ranked content first
roust "connection pooling" ~/code/httpx --budget 2048

# Cap the file count directly
roust "connection pooling" ~/code/httpx --k 8

# Scannable list instead of packed code
roust "connection pooling" ~/code/httpx --files-only
```

One honest caveat: shrinking the budget trades away recall roughly linearly
(measured -- see issue #4's tail-cut experiment log), so leave the default
alone for agent use.

## Using with coding agents

This is the point of the tool: an agent that reaches for `roust` before
`grep` gets the files it needs in one shot, without needing to iterate on
search terms across a much larger result set. Don't lower `--budget` in
agent configs -- the breadth is the product, since the agent reads
selectively rather than top-to-bottom; a smaller budget just trades away
measured recall for no benefit to the agent.

### Claude Code

Add to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Code search

Before using grep/find/glob to explore this repo, run roust first:

- `roust "<question or issue text>" --files-only` to localize which files
  are relevant.
- `roust "<question or issue text>"` to get a packed bundle of the actual
  relevant code, ready to read.

Pass the raw question or issue text as the query -- don't summarize or
clean it up first. Include error messages, stack traces, file paths, and
backtick-quoted symbol/function names verbatim; roust uses those as
high-precision anchors. Only fall back to grep for a literal string match
roust's bundle doesn't cover.
```

And allowlist it in `.claude/settings.json` so it runs without a permission
prompt:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Bash(roust *)"]
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Add to `.cursorrules`:

```
Before grepping this repo, run `roust "<question or issue text>" --files-only`
(or without --files-only for a packed code bundle) in the terminal to find
relevant files. Pass the raw question/issue text as the query, including
error strings and backtick-quoted symbol names -- don't paraphrase it first.
```

### Aider

Invoke it from chat with `/run`:

```
/run roust "TypeError in connection pool cleanup" --files-only
```

And add a line to `CONVENTIONS.md`:

```
Search this repo with `roust "<raw question or error text>"` before grep --
it returns a token-budgeted bundle of the relevant code directly.
```

### OpenAI Codex CLI / generic agents

Add to `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
## Code search

Run `roust "<question or issue text>" --files-only` to localize relevant
files, or `roust "<question or issue text>"` for a ready-to-read code
bundle. Pass the raw question/issue text verbatim as the query (error
messages, paths, and backtick-quoted symbols included) rather than a
cleaned-up paraphrase.
```

### MCP

No MCP server yet (it's on the roadmap) -- roust is shell-first by design
today, since every agent already has a shell and `roust` is a single
subprocess call with structured `--json` output when you need it.

> **Query tips for agents**
> - Pass the raw issue/question text verbatim as the query.
> - Include error messages, stack traces, and symbol names -- don't strip
>   them out.
> - Don't summarize the question into clean prose first: measured on
>   adversarial paraphrases that drop key terms, task recall falls from
>   1.00 to 0.833 (14/19 tasks) -- summarization removes the anchors roust
>   relies on. See "Known limits" in `lab/README.md`.

## How it works

- **BM25F** over identifier subtokens (camelCase/snake_case split, Porter-lite
  stemming), with path tokens as a separate weighted field and an
  implementation-file prior (tests/docs/examples down-weighted).
- **1-hop structural expansion** over the import/same-package graph, with RM3
  pseudo-relevance feedback carrying evidence from lexical hits to their
  quiet neighbors.
- **Commit-message channel**: git history text folded in as a monotone
  addition-only signal (never reorders the lexical head).
- **Definition-symbol anchors**: rarity-gated (symbol defined in ≤3 impl
  files), tiered promotion so only strong anchors can enter the top ranks.
- **Test/docs bridges**: tests and docs are treated as developer-written
  natural-language-to-code mappings, appended tail-only.
- **Greedy weighted-coverage region packing** under a token budget, so the
  final bundle is code regions, not whole files, chosen to maximize coverage
  per token.

Every component above was added to fix a concrete, measured miss, and every
number in this README is reproduced in the pipeline's research log,
including negative results and a pre-registered held-out validation run:
see [`lab/README.md`](lab/README.md).

## Scoreboard

Given the same task and the same agent (tokenbench v2, live Sonnet 4.5, each method as the agent's only tool), roust solves **93.3%** of tasks, grep **26.7%**, embedding-RAG **80.0%** (9-trial mean) — n=15, a partial run (see below). roust is **not** the most accurate retriever available: trained retrievers (see *Localization accuracy* below) score higher on published localization benchmarks. What roust offers is the best result you can get for free — no model, no embeddings, no API key, no training.

### Agent-loop outcomes (our protocol)

| System | Solves | Median turns | Tokens / attempt | $ / attempt | $ / successful run |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **roust** | 93.3% | 9 | 308,184 | $0.95 | $0.93 |
| grep | 26.7% | 30 | 239,600 | $0.76 | $0.53 |
| embedding-RAG | 80.0% (9-trial mean ± 4.4pp) | 20 | 695,833 | $2.14 | $1.80 |
| roust + grep (both) | 57.1% | 28 | 595,234 | $1.83 | $1.60 |
| grep + stopping prompt | 20.0% | — | 52,576 | $0.17 | $0.18 |
| roust + stopping prompt | 66.7% | — | 241,027 | $0.74 | $0.63 |

- roust costs more per attempt than grep (308k vs 240k tokens) and wins on solve rate anyway. grep is cheap because it gives up: 73.3% of its runs hit the turn cap and produce nothing.
- `$ / successful run` remains a lower bound on cost-to-answer for a single attempt. The full repeat-run campaign (#16, `results_repeats.jsonl`) measured the rest: for roust and grep, failures are **stable across trials** (p≈0 — the retry term is meaningless; roust's one miss failed 10/10), while embedding-RAG's failures are genuinely stochastic, giving **E[cost to first success] = $2.50** over its solvable set (all 15 instances, per-instance p̂ 0.11–1.00).
- Giving the agent grep *alongside* roust makes it worse (93.3% → 57.1%): replace grep, don't supplement it ([#5](https://github.com/narehart/roust/issues/5)).
- embedding-RAG's **Solves** cell is a 9-trial mean, `lab/tokenbench/results_repeats.jsonl`; its other columns (median turns, tokens, $) are the trial-0 measurement, `lab/tokenbench/results.jsonl`.
- Outcome volatility (measured across 9 identical trial repeats, `lab/tokenbench/results_repeats.jsonl`): embedding-RAG bounces 73.3–86.7% across 9 identical runs (mean 80.0% ± 4.4pp); roust reproduced 93.3% exactly with 0 outcome flips across all repeats, and its single failure (django-16400) failed 10/10 trials — a capability gap, not variance (p < 0.30 at 95%, rule of three). grep's failures were stable across both its trials.

| archex (vector/hybrid) | 57.3 | Agentless-metric FILE | yes (local index + FastEmbed/ONNX) | `lab/results_regions/agentless_metric_archex_vector.json` |

— = not measured by us (see gaps below). archex has two rows: its default retrieval mode (BM25+graph, no embeddings) and its optional vector/hybrid mode (FastEmbed/ONNX + graph) — both are now measured, see [#1](https://github.com/narehart/roust/issues/1).

The File-level column mixes several different metrics (Acc@10 / Top-1 / file-match / Agentless-metric FILE) and is **not** comparable straight down the column — each row names its own. roust's Agentless-metric scores on Lite are FILE 92.3% / FUNCTION 41.0% (exact) / LINE 35.7%; Agentless (GPT-4o) for comparison is 69.7 / 52.0 / 35.3; archex (BM25 default) is 56.0 / 38.3 / 25.7 (`lab/results_regions/agentless_metric_archex_bm25.json`, 2 of 300 instances timed out and count as wrong); archex (vector/hybrid) is 57.3 / 40.7 / 27.7 (`lab/results_regions/agentless_metric_archex_vector.json`, same 2 timeouts) — a single-digit gain over BM25 that leaves the ~35-point FILE gap to roust unchanged. Region precision (gold lines returned / total lines returned, i.e. "how much of the packed context is actually the fix") is 0.45% mean — roust trades precision for recall by design, packing ~1,150 lines of surrounding context per instance under the 8192-token budget ([#4](https://github.com/narehart/roust/issues/4)).

### Latency (measured, `lab/latency/latency_v1.json`)

Cold index (median of 3, `.roust/` removed each time), warm index (median of
5, cache hit), and query time (p50/p95 of 20 queries cycling 10
problem-statement-like phrases, warm cache) — `index_ms`/`query_ms` from
`--json` output, plus end-to-end subprocess wall time, the number that
matches what an agent actually experiences ([#15](https://github.com/narehart/roust/issues/15)):

| Repo | Files indexed | Cold index (index / wall) | Warm index (index / wall) | Query index p50 / p95 | Query wall p50 / p95 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| roust (this repo) | 66 | 145ms / 302ms | 24ms / 181ms | 109ms / 148ms | 140ms / 180ms |
| requests | 122 | 128ms / 244ms | 23ms / 144ms | 81ms / 111ms | 114ms / 144ms |
| flask | 77 | 184ms / 300ms | 25ms / 142ms | 97ms / 107ms | 129ms / 142ms |
| django | 2,131 | 1538ms / 1756ms | 195ms / 412ms | 158ms / 246ms | 363ms / 451ms |

Measured on an Apple M3 Max (arm64), engine `roust 0.2.0 (418212b, clean)`.
Roughly a third of the wall-clock time at this repo size is fixed subprocess
startup overhead, not indexing or query work — visible as the gap between
`index_ms`/`query_ms` and the wall-time column above. Full samples, machine
info, and per-repo `files_indexed`/disk-size in `lab/latency/latency_v1.json`;
methodology in `lab/latency/bench_latency.py`.

Competitor latency: archex (BM25 default mode) query wall time on the SWE-bench
Lite corpora, `lab/results_regions/archex300_bm25_v1.jsonl` — index mean 5.69s,
query median 9.68s (2 of 300 queries hit the 300s timeout); archex (vector/hybrid
mode), `lab/results_regions/archex300_vector_v1.jsonl` — index mean 0.92s, query
median 12.98s (same 2 timeouts), worse than BM25 despite the faster index; vs
roust's 0.1–0.4s wall time above on comparable repos ([#1](https://github.com/narehart/roust/issues/1)).

*Historical note:* an earlier claim (never backed by a committed artifact)
compared the (now-deleted) Python engine against the Rust port directly —
"Rust 3.6–4.2× faster than Python engine (httpx 145ms vs 522ms, django 1.8s
vs 7.6s)". The Python engine was removed in #12, so that comparison is no
longer reproducible; it's kept here only as a historical data point, not a
current claim.

### ContextBench (human-annotated gold context, their evaluator)

[ContextBench](https://github.com/EuniAI/ContextBench) (arXiv:2602.05892) scores
retrieved context against human-annotated "necessary context" line regions.
roust was run one-shot (`--json --budget 8192`, single call, no model) on the
**Python subset of their curated 500-instance Verified benchmark (266 tasks, 19
repos, 266/266 evaluated, 0 skipped)** and scored with ContextBench's own
evaluator, unmodified ([#3](https://github.com/narehart/roust/issues/3)):

| Granularity | roust recall | roust precision | Claude Sonnet 4.5 agent recall | precision |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| file | **0.679** | 0.060 | 0.720 | 0.665 |
| block | 0.346 | 0.040 | 0.449 | 0.420 |
| line | 0.274 | 0.053 | 0.374 | 0.344 |

Protocols differ and the comparison is not apples-to-apples: the published
baselines are **multi-turn LLM agents** (read, navigate, then select context)
on the full 500-task 8-language set; roust is a **single sub-2-second call
with no model, no API key, and no training**, on the Python 266. Read it as:
one free one-shot call recovers ~94% of the file-level recall of the best
agent, and its precision is ~10x lower because roust deliberately packs a
full 8192-token recall-first bundle rather than a minimal answer — the same
recall-over-precision trade documented in
[#4](https://github.com/narehart/roust/issues/4). ContextBench's efficiency
metrics (AUC-Coverage/Redundancy) are N/A for a one-step trajectory.
Adapter + protocol: `lab/contextbench/`; aggregate:
`lab/contextbench/results_python.json`.

### What still needs work

- ~~Line-level 35.7% and function-level 44.3% (a proxy, not the exact metric)~~ measured exactly ([#2](https://github.com/narehart/roust/issues/2)): FUNCTION 39.7% (exact, was a 44.3% proxy) and LINE 29.3% (was 35.7%) from a fresh 300-instance run of the shipped engine; a `w_name` sweep on the exact harness ([#4](https://github.com/narehart/roust/issues/4)) then showed the symbol-name weighting itself caused the LINE drop — reverting it (w_name=0.0) restores FUNCTION 41.0% (exact) and LINE 35.7% (`lab/results_regions/agentless_metric_v3.json`). FUNCTION is still the weakest cell vs Agentless GPT-4o's 52.0 — [#3](https://github.com/narehart/roust/issues/3)
- ~~archex has never been measured by us on any of our benches~~ both Agentless-metric arms measured ([#1](https://github.com/narehart/roust/issues/1)): archex 0.19.2 BM25 default mode is FILE 56.0 / FUNCTION 38.3 / LINE 25.7 (`lab/results_regions/agentless_metric_archex_bm25.json`); vector/hybrid mode is FILE 57.3 / FUNCTION 40.7 / LINE 27.7 (`lab/results_regions/agentless_metric_archex_vector.json`), a single-digit gain over BM25 with worse latency (12.98s vs 9.68s query median) that leaves the ~35-point FILE gap to roust unchanged — steelman complete; the tokenbench agent-loop arm is not justified at current quality
- ~~True cost-per-success~~ measured via repeat runs ([#16](https://github.com/narehart/roust/issues/16)): roust solves 14/15 deterministically at ~$1/answer with one real capability gap (django-16400, 0/10); embedding-RAG reaches everything eventually at $2.50/first-success — see `results_repeats.jsonl`
- ~~Latency has no committed benchmark artifact~~ measured ([#15](https://github.com/narehart/roust/issues/15)): cold/warm index + query p50/p95 across four repo sizes (66–2,131 files indexed), `lab/latency/latency_v1.json`

### How these were measured

*Agent-loop outcomes* is our agent-loop harness (live Sonnet 4.5, each method as the agent's only tool, measured to task completion) — a partial run, 58 of 120 planned pairs, stopped at an $80 spend cap, so n=15 (14 for embedding-RAG). *Localization accuracy* is published Acc@k-style numbers from each system's own paper, on its own harness — a different protocol, not comparable to the agent-loop numbers. Full artifacts and the research log (including the retracted "95% fewer tokens than grep" claim, which came from a v1 one-shot protocol and does not hold in the agent loop — [#6](https://github.com/narehart/roust/issues/6)) are in `lab/README.md`.

## Limits

- **File-level, not line-level.** roust localizes to files and packs regions
  within them; it doesn't point at a specific line or diff hunk.
- **@1 precision is the measured weak spot.** Top-1 file accuracy on the
  held-out SWE-bench Verified set is .354 -- if you need "the one file",
  read further down the ranked list, don't trust rank 1 alone.
- **Natural-language issues with no identifiers are the hard class.** Every
  non-semantic retrieval method (roust included) leans on identifiers, paths,
  and error strings as anchors; a vague prose description with none of those
  gives the pipeline little to grab onto.
- **Python gets the full signal set** (import graph, definition-symbol
  index). Other languages (JS/TS, Go, Rust, Java, etc.) get a best-effort
  subset -- lexical/BM25F, paths, and history still apply, but there's no
  import-graph or def-index expansion yet.

## Roadmap

- ~~Rust port~~ **complete and shipped as the only engine**: `roust-rs/` was
  brought to feature-parity with the (now-deleted) Python v0.2 engine
  (channel-aware packing, on-disk cache with incremental updates,
  deterministic seed) — bundle-level parity gate **PASSED 300/300 exact**
  on SWE-bench Lite (report in `parity/rust_gate_300_v3.json`) before the
  Python engine was removed. Measured absolute latency (cold/warm index,
  query p50/p95) is in the Scoreboard's Latency block above
  (`lab/latency/latency_v1.json`, [#15](https://github.com/narehart/roust/issues/15));
  the old cold-index Rust-vs-Python ratio is no longer reproducible and is
  kept there only as a historical note. Build from source: `cd roust-rs &&
  cargo build --release`.
- ~~Publish to PyPI~~ **done** — `pip install roust` ships the maturin-built
  wheel wrapping the Rust binary.
- MCP server.
- Incremental index updates (avoid full reindex on every change).
- Homebrew tap.

behavior, which is `roust-rs/` end to end.

## History

Formerly `bgrep`; renamed to avoid collision with the binary-grep tool of
that name.
