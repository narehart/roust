# PARITY_NOTES.md

Every Python-semantics trap the Rust port had to reproduce byte-for-byte
against `lab/lanes2.py` + `lab/history.py` (the frozen v7 pipeline), plus how
each was resolved in `src/`. Ordered roughly by where you'd hit them reading
the pipeline top to bottom: filesystem walk -> tokenization -> corpus/BM25 ->
import graph -> select_files -> history mining -> region packing.

Validated by:
- `parity/shim_reference.py` micro-parity on 5 hand-picked httpx queries
  (exact ranked-file-list match).
- `parity/harness.py --suite lite --limit 40` (SWE-bench Lite gate):
  **40/40 exact-match** against the frozen `abl_bridges_v7.jsonl` expectations
  (astropy + django instances).

## 1. `str.splitlines()` vs Rust `str::lines()` (`src/pyutil.rs::py_splitlines`)

Python's `str.splitlines()` recognizes a much broader set of line boundaries
than `\n`/`\r\n`: `\r`, `\v` (0x0B), `\f` (0x0C), `\x1c`-`\x1e`, `\x85` (NEL),
U+2028 (LS), U+2029 (PS). This matters for `history.py`'s `git log` stdout
parsing (commit messages can contain any of these) and for line-splitting in
`pack_regions`. `py_splitlines` hand-replicates the exact boundary set and the
"no trailing empty element" rule.

## 2. `Path(rel).parent` renders `"."` for a top-level path (`py_parent`)

Rust's `Path::parent()` on `"foo.py"` yields `Some("")`, but
`str(Path("foo.py").parent)` in Python is `"."`. Every same-package /
same-directory grouping in `select_files` (`same_dir[str(Path(rel).parent)]`)
and the JS/TS relative-import resolver depend on this exact string, so
`py_parent`/`py_parent_name` special-case it.

## 3. `os.path.normpath(str(Path(base) / spec))` for JS/TS import resolution
   (`normpath_join`)

`build_import_graph`'s relative-import resolver joins a base directory with a
`./` or `../` specifier and lexically normalizes it (no filesystem access).
`normpath_join` replicates pathlib's part-dropping (bare `"."` components
vanish) plus `normpath`'s `".."`-against-preceding-component resolution,
including the "unresolvable leading `..` is kept as-is" edge case.

## 4. `sorted(Path.rglob("*"))` orders by **parts tuple**, not the joined string
   (`path_sort_key`, `Corpus::build`'s file collection)

`("test", "a.py") < ("test.py",)` under component-wise tuple comparison,
because `"test" < "test.py"` as a standalone string, even though naive
string comparison of the *joined* forms would put `"test.py"` first (`'.' <
'/'` in byte/codepoint order). Every place the corpus file list's order
matters (BM25 iteration for stable tie-breaks, `corpus.files` traversal
order) sorts by `rel.split('/')` component vectors, not the raw string.

## 5. `str.lower()` (`py_lower`)

Rust's `to_lowercase()` uses full Unicode case folding; Python's `str.lower()`
uses the Unicode default mapping. For the ASCII-dominated identifier/path
text this pipeline tokenizes, the two are byte-identical, so `py_lower` is a
thin wrapper kept only so any future non-ASCII divergence has one place to
patch (documented risk, not an observed one).

## 6. `Counter.most_common()` tie-breaking = insertion order, not hash order
   (`src/history.rs::most_common`, `OrderedCounter = IndexMap<String, i64>`)

Python's `Counter` is a `dict` subclass: `.most_common()` is a stable sort by
count descending, so ties preserve first-insertion order. `history.rs` uses
`IndexMap` everywhere a Python `dict`/`Counter` is ported (never `HashMap`,
whose Rust iteration order is unspecified and, without a fixed hasher, is
per-process-random via SipHash), and `most_common` is a stable
`sort_by(|a,b| b.1.cmp(&a.1))` over a Vec built by iterating that IndexMap in
insertion order -- exactly reproducing Python's tie-break.

## 7. `dict`/`set` iteration order and hash-randomization exposure
   (`core.rs`, throughout)

Almost the entire pipeline is safe from Python's per-process hash-seed
randomization because `lanes2.py`/`history.py` only ever iterate `dict`s
(insertion-ordered, deterministic) or *pre-sorted* material derived from a
`set` (e.g. `combinations(sorted(set(code_files)), 2)`). The Rust port mirrors
this file-by-file: `IndexMap` wherever Python code relies on dict insertion
order (BM25 score accumulation, TF/DF counters, cochange maps, the `Explain`
diagnostic pool), plain `HashMap`/`HashSet` only where the corresponding
Python data structure is *never* iterated in an order-sensitive way (pure
membership/lookup use).

The **one genuine exception** is `build_import_graph`'s adjacency map: in
Python, `edges[s]` is a raw `set[str]`, and `select_files`'s
`neighbors = list(edges.get(s, ())) + same_dir.get(...)` does iterate it,
feeding candidate `pool`/`owner` assignment (`if w > pool.get(c, 0.0):
pool[c] = w`). A raw Python `set`'s iteration order depends on hash-seed
randomization and insertion history, so which of several *equal-weight*
neighbors "wins" a `pool[c] = w` tie in the reference implementation is
itself nondeterministic across separate interpreter runs of `lanes2.py`. The
Rust port makes the deliberate, documented choice to use `BTreeSet` (sorted
iteration) for `EdgeMap`'s adjacency sets -- a fixed, reproducible tie-break
standing in for genuinely-undefined Python behavior, not a deviation from a
well-defined one. In practice `w` only differs when `s` (the owning source)
differs, and sources are processed in `lex_picks` order, so this tie-break is
rarely if ever live; the 40/40 exact-match SWE-bench Lite gate (which
includes several large-fan-out import graphs on django/astropy) is the
empirical confirmation it doesn't matter in practice. See `core.rs`'s
`EdgeMap`/`build_import_graph` doc comments (referred to elsewhere in the
codebase as "PARITY_NOTES.md item 2").

## 8. Stable sort + matching pre-sort order reproduces Python's `sorted()` ties

Every `ranked.sort_by(...)` / `weighted.sort_by(...)` call in `select_files`
and its helpers (lex-pick ranking, RM3-lite feedback-term weighting, the
structural-expansion candidate pool, msg-field top-up, docsbridge page
ranking) omits an explicit tie-break, exactly like the Python
`sorted(items, key=lambda kv: -kv[1])` calls it ports. This is safe *only*
because (a) Rust's `sort_by`/`sort_unstable_by`-adjacent `Vec::sort_by` is a
stable sort (same guarantee as Python's Timsort), and (b) the pre-sort
iteration order of the source `IndexMap`/`Vec` is itself already
Python-insertion-order-identical (see items 6-7). Get either half wrong and
ties silently reorder on any repo with real score collisions -- which is
exactly the class of bug this parity pass found (item 9).

## 9. THE BUG: `git log --pretty <value>` (two argv tokens) is rejected by git
   (`src/history.rs::mine_history`) -- **fixed during this pass**

`Command::new("git").args(["log", ..., "--pretty", &pretty, "--name-only"])`
passes `--pretty` and its format string as two separate argv elements. Git
does **not** accept `--pretty` with a space-separated value the way most
GNU-style CLI options do -- it only accepts `--pretty=<value>` (or the
short-hand having no separate-token form at all for this particular option).
Passed as two tokens, git parses `--pretty` as a bare flag (default format)
and then treats the following token (`"format:__C__%at%x00%an%x00%s%n%b"`) as
a revision/pathspec argument, which is not a valid object name, so the
process exits 128 with `fatal: invalid object name 'format'.` on stderr.

`mine_history`'s error handling (`Ok(o) if o.status.success() => o, _ =>
return HistoryData::default()`) swallows this silently, so **every** call to
`mine_history` returned an empty `msgs`/`cochange`/`meta` -- not just on large
repos. This was invisible in the initial 5-query httpx micro-parity check
(step 3) purely by luck: httpx's git history doesn't happen to add anything
via the cochange/msg-bm25 top-up channels for those specific 5 queries, so
Python-with-working-history and Rust-with-empty-history produced identical
`files` lists. It became visible immediately on the 40-task SWE-bench Lite
gate (0/40 exact-match, but 40/40 top-10-match -- the bug only ever affects
the *tail* additions, never the top lexical picks, which is exactly what
`select_files`'s "history is monotone-append-only" design guarantees).

Fix: build the format string as a single `--pretty=format:...` argv token:

```rust
let pretty = format!("--pretty=format:{SENTINEL}%at%x00%an%x00%s%n%b");
Command::new("git").args(["log", "--no-merges", "-n", &max_commits.to_string(), &pretty, "--name-only"])
```

Lesson for future ports: verify every subprocess invocation directly (`git
log ... > out; echo $?`) rather than trusting that "it compiled and returned
some files" means the command actually ran the way the caller intended --
this class of bug produces a *plausible*, non-crashing, silently-degraded
result (empty history is a legal, common state for a fresh/shallow repo), so
nothing about the program's behavior signals the failure.

## 10. `Path.suffix` vs `str.endswith` for extension filtering

`Corpus`'s file-walk filter checks `p.suffix in CODE_EXTENSIONS` (Python
`pathlib.Path.suffix`: the last dotted component of the *final path segment*
only -- a file named `a.b.py` has suffix `.py`, and a dotfile like
`.gitignore` has suffix `""`). `has_code_suffix`/`suffix_of` in `core.rs`
replicate this exactly, distinct from `is_code_file`'s simpler
`rel.ends_with(ext)` check used by the (separate, `swebench_driver2.py`
-mirroring) `list_current_files` pre-filter in `main.rs`, which the Python
reference (`shim_reference.py::_list_current_files`) also implements via
`p.suffix not in L.CODE_EXTENSIONS` -- both call sites use the pathlib
`.suffix` semantics, and `main.rs::list_current_files` matches via
`ends_with`, which is equivalent for this specific extension set (none of
`CODE_EXTENSIONS` is a suffix of another) but is a documented "happens to be
equivalent, not deliberately identical logic" spot.

## 11. Python `round()` is banker's rounding (round-half-to-even)

Used only in the `--explain` diagnostic dump (`py_round` in `core.rs`), which
mirrors `lanes2.py`'s `LAST_EXPLAIN` pool-score rounding
(`round(add_score(c), 4)`). Not on any scoring hot path, but the Explain
output is a debugging/parity tool in its own right (used throughout this
pass to localize the git log bug), so it needs to itself be trustworthy.

## 12. Regex lookahead: `_CAMEL_RE`'s `(?=[A-Z][a-z])` (`camel_matches`)

Rust's `regex` crate doesn't support lookahead. `subtokens`' camelCase
splitter (`camel_matches` in `core.rs`) is a hand-rolled character scanner
replicating `_CAMEL_RE = r"[A-Z]+(?=[A-Z][a-z])|[A-Z]?[a-z]+|[A-Z]+|[0-9]+"`'s
exact match boundaries (e.g. `"HTTPServer"` -> `["HTTP", "Server"]`, the
lookahead is what keeps the trailing `S` of an all-caps run with the
following word instead of the run). Covered by
`core::tests::camel_matches_edge_cases`.

## Not a trap, but worth flagging: `personalized_pagerank` is dead code

`core.rs::personalized_pagerank` is a structural port of
`lanes2.py::personalized_pagerank`, but `select_files(use_ppr=True)` never
actually calls it in either the Python or the Rust pipeline -- the
"structural expansion" block reimplements a different additive
pool/owner/add_score scheme directly. Kept `#[allow(dead_code)]` for
completeness/documentation parity, not exercised by any live code path.

## Verified working (not a trap, confirmed by the 40/40 gate)

- BM25F term/file iteration order (`Corpus::bm25_params`): drives every term
  outer-loop, file inner-loop, matching `lanes2.py`'s direct
  `for rel in self.files` nesting, so `scores.entry(rel).or_insert(0.0) +=`
  accumulation order -- and therefore the `IndexMap`'s resulting insertion
  order for BM25-score ties -- matches Python's dict-insertion order exactly.
- `select_files`'s guarantee-0/1/2 additions ordering, RM3-lite feedback-term
  selection, cochange-strength promotion, msg-field top-up cutoff (`0.35 *
  msg_max`), and anchor/testbridge/docsbridge tail-only promotions all
  reproduce byte-for-byte once the history-mining bug (item 9) was fixed.
- `pack_regions`' token-budget packing (tiktoken `cl100k_base`, same encoder
  as the Python `tiktoken` package) produces identical region spans and
  bundle text on every gate task.

## 13. Region packing v2 (channel-aware, idf-weighted) -- ported from
    `bgrep.core` (commit `2a95329`), not `lab/lanes2.py`

`lab/lanes2.py` is the frozen-v7 pipeline this port otherwise tracks
byte-for-byte, but `pack_regions`/`_python_blocks` moved on in the packaged
`bgrep.core` module after v7 froze: nested (not column-0-only) Python block
spans (`python_blocks` in `core.rs`), idf-weighted (not flat-counted) term
coverage in the gain/marginal scores, and an `anchor_symbols`-driven forced
region (`anchor_def_symbols`, seated via `py_def_line_numbers` matching a
span's start line to a symbol's def line) for definition-symbol-anchored
files. `core.rs`'s `pack_regions`/`python_blocks`/`anchor_def_symbols` track
`bgrep.core` (the packaged module), not the frozen lab snapshot. Verified via
a direct `Corpus`/`select_files`/`pack_regions` comparison against the
Python reference on `encode/httpx@0.28.1` for 5 queries plus one
hand-constructed anchor-forced-region case (`httpx/_client.py`'s `Client` class,
~1150 lines deep in a 2019-line file -- exactly the "gold hunk past a large
class's first method" scenario `_python_blocks`' nesting targets): every
file's span list and the packed bundle's token count matched exactly,
including the anchor-forced case where the forced region's span differs from
the same file's non-anchored packing.

## 14. On-disk index cache (`cache.rs`) -- ported from `bgrep.cache`
    (commit `16e7c71`)

Same manifest-diff + classify (`unchanged`/`modified`/`full`) + incremental-
patch design as `bgrep.cache`, with two deliberate differences:

- **Serialization**: `serde_json`, not a pickle-equivalent binary format.
  `serde_json` is already a direct dependency (used for `--json`/`--explain`
  output), so caching adds no new dependency; every cached type (`Corpus`,
  `EdgeMap`, `HistoryData`) derives plain `serde::{Serialize, Deserialize}`
  with no custom (de)serialization code. This is an internal
  implementation-detail choice, not load-bearing for parity -- a future pass
  is free to swap in a binary format purely for size/speed.
- **Cache file isolation**: written to `<repo>/.bgrep/rust-index.bin`, a
  DIFFERENT filename from Python's `<repo>/.bgrep/index.pkl`, so the two
  independent implementations never attempt to read each other's cache file.
  Running `bgrep` and `bgrep-rs` against the same repo concurrently is
  therefore always safe.

One deliberate ROBUSTNESS deviation (not a parity gap -- the Python behavior
here is an unintentional latent bug, not a documented contract):
`bgrep.cache._scan_manifest`'s coarse stat-only walk doesn't apply
`Corpus`'s own vendor-regex/oversize/long-line filters, so a "modified" rel
can name a file that was stat-scanned but never actually indexed into the
cached `Corpus` (e.g. a vendor-path file). Python's
`_try_incremental_update` has no guard for this and would raise an uncaught
`KeyError` (`corpus.text[rel]`) if it ever triggered.
`cache::try_incremental_update` instead declines incrementally (forcing the
always-safe full-rebuild fallback) whenever a modified code/docs rel is
absent from the loaded `Corpus`'s `text`/`docs_text` maps -- strictly more
robust, and never changes the observable result, since "decline and rebuild"
is exactly what this module's own documented invariant already promises for
any patch it can't apply.

Equivalence verified by `tests/incremental.rs` (a port of
`tests/test_incremental.py`'s property test): a scripted sequence of
content-only edits to a synthetic repo, asserting after each edit that the
`unchanged`/`incremental`/`full` path taken matches expectation AND that the
resulting `Corpus` gives byte-identical `select_files()` file lists and
(9-decimal-rounded) scores to an independently fresh-built `Corpus`, across
add/remove-triggers-full-rebuild, docs-field patching, and the
import-graph "reverse edge survives if the other side still authors it"
case.
