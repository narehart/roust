# bgrep lab — retrieval experiments

> **⚠️ RETRACTED CLAIM (see [#6](https://github.com/narehart/roust/issues/6)).** The token-savings-vs-grep figures below (95.7% / 95.2% / 94.7% mean savings) are measured correctly **under the v1 protocol** — a single deterministic retrieval pass, counting the tokens of the retrieved content set — but that protocol is **not how an agent actually uses the tool**, and the savings framing derived from it is retracted.
>
> Under the agent-loop protocol (tokenbench v2), where a live model decides when to stop searching, **roust uses MORE tokens per attempt than grep** (308k vs 240k mean API tokens), and wins on **success rate** (93.3% vs 26.7%) instead. grep's low token count is a symptom of it giving up: 73% of its runs hit the turn cap and produce nothing.
>
> The numbers below are kept as an accurate record of what v1 measured. Do not quote them as a savings claim. See the root README's Scoreboard for the current, agent-loop numbers, and [#16](https://github.com/narehart/roust/issues/16) for the unmeasured true cost-per-success.

Goal: LLM-agent code retrieval with **recall 1.00, missed-task 0.00**, tested
on the [archex](https://github.com/Mathews-Tom/archex) head-to-head benchmark
(real repos at pinned versions, archex's own metric and tiktoken accounting).
The original goal statement also targeted "≥70% fewer tokens than grep" as a
retrieval-pass metric; under the agent-loop protocol that framing does not
hold (see retraction banner above) — the current result is recall/success
under equal agent budget, not token savings.

## Results (2026-07-10)

| lane | mean tokens/task | file recall | missed-task |
|---|---|---|---|
| raw grep + read matched files | 1,180,370 | 1.00 | 0.00 |
| disciplined grep (read ±25 lines around matches) | 764,759 | 1.00 | 0.00 |
| oracle (read exactly the expected files) | 26,395 | 1.00 | 0.00 |
| archex (embeddings, published artifacts) | 6,433 | 0.947 | 0.158 |
| **bgrep pipeline (packed regions)** | **8,317** | **1.00** | **0.00** |

- Dev set: 19/19 tasks at recall 1.00; savings vs raw grep mean 95.7%, min 76.0%. **[RETRACTED as a savings claim — v1 protocol only; see #6]**
- Held-out set (21 `loc_*` fault-localization tasks, frozen config): 21/21 at
  recall 1.00; savings mean 95.2%, min 74.9%. **[RETRACTED as a savings claim — v1 protocol only; see #6]**
- vs the *disciplined* grep control the pipeline still saves ≥72% on every task
  (mean 94.7%) — discipline removes only ~35% of grep's cost because keyword
  matches are everywhere in a large repo. **[RETRACTED as a savings claim — v1 protocol only; see #6]**

## The pipeline (lanes.py — pure Python, no models, no embeddings)

1. **BM25F** over identifier subtokens (camelCase/snake_case split, Porter-lite
   stemming), path tokens as a weighted field, implementation-file prior
   (tests/docs/examples 0.3×).
2. **1-hop structural expansion** of the whole retrieved set over the
   import/same-package graph, with **RM3 pseudo-relevance feedback** carrying
   evidence from hits to their lexically-quiet neighbors; guarantees for
   direct-import dependencies and discriminative path matches (path-df < 10%);
   evidence-threshold cutoff.
3. **Greedy weighted-coverage region packing** under an 8k token budget,
   evidence-proportional per-file allowances.

Every component was added to fix a concrete observed miss (see HYPOTHESES.md
and git history). Negative results: global personalized PageRank loses to
truncated 1-hop diffusion (hub sink); every fixed-count cutoff caused
whack-a-mole between tasks; per-seed quotas starve globally-strong candidates.

## Known limits (measured)

- **Vocabulary brittleness**: with helper keywords dropped, natural paraphrases
  keep 16/19 tasks at recall 1.00 (mean 0.939); adversarial paraphrases that
  avoid the key terms drop to 14/19 (mean 0.833). Consistent with CORE-Bench
  (2026): the fix is **anchor preservation** — callers should pass raw task
  text (error strings, API names, identifiers) rather than cleaned summaries;
  query *cleanup* hurts even dense retrievers. bgrep's caller is an LLM agent,
  which can supply anchor-rich multi-variant queries nearly for free.
- **Depth vs breadth is budget-bound**: bundles pack ~15-26 files into 8k
  tokens. Evidence-proportional allocation helps only marginally (+3%); depth
  is a caller-set budget knob, not a packing-cleverness problem. Literature
  (SWE-bench oracle-collapsed ablation; SWE-Explore degradation study) says
  recall-first / precision-second is the right trade for modern models.
- Recall 1.00 is empirical over 40 tasks / 17 repos / 5 languages, not a
  guarantee. archex comprehension tasks have 1–5 expected files; harder
  issue-to-edit benchmarks (SWE-bench) remain unmeasured for this pipeline.

## Literature context (deep-research pass, 2026-07-10, adversarially verified)

- One-shot indexed retrieval (BM25 *or* dense) fails at repo scale: BM25
  recovers all gold files in <46% of SWE-bench instances at realistic budgets;
  strong embedders collapse on issue-to-edit localization (CORE-Bench);
  non-agentic retrievers score near random on SWE-Explore while agentic
  explorers reach only ~0.65 file-recall.
- Graph expansion measurably lifts *file-level* localization (+4.4–6.7 pts,
  RepoGraph, ICLR 2025) — the exact mechanism and granularity this pipeline
  exploits. AST/region chunking beats whole files at any budget (cAST, EMNLP
  2025; SWE-bench Table 6).
- GrepRAG (2025): optimized grep-style pipelines beat indexed RAG under equal
  budgets with ~35× latency advantage — supporting the no-embedding design.

## SWE-bench Lite file localization (2026-07-11)

Query = raw issue text, no LLM, no embeddings, no training. Gold = files edited
by the merged fix. 300 instances, zero errors, fully deterministic.

Ablation (File@k = all gold files within top-k of the ranked list):

| lane | @1 | @5 | @10 | @all | mean tokens |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| v1 pipeline | .470 | .733 | .803 | .890 | 10,041 |
| + vendor/minified exclusion, pack safety | .463 | .737 | .813 | .893 | 8,461 |
| + comments field (REJECTED) | .357 | .670 | .773 | .867 | 8,453 |
| + history via RRF fusion (REJECTED) | .337 | .643 | .757 | .890 | 8,457 |
| **+ history as monotone additions (final)** | **.463** | **.737** | **.813** | **.910** | **8,492** |
| + def-symbol anchors, flat promotion (superseded) | .463 | .737 | .823 | .917 | 8,515 |
| **+ def-symbol anchors, tiered** | **.463** | **.737** | **.827** | **.920** | **8,515** |
| + test-bridge with head tier (superseded) | .463 | .737 | .810 | .927 | 8,544 |
| **+ tail-only test+docs bridges (FROZEN v7)** | **.463** | **.737** | **.827** | **.923** | **8,549** |

Final: 91.0% of instances get every gold file, ~8.5k-token bundle, 530ms query.
Verified SOTA context (SweRank, arXiv:2505.07849): trained embedders reach
Acc@10 90.9 (137M) / 94.2 (7B); +LLM rerank 96.0; BM25 61.7. bgrep holds the
training-free/model-free point: File@10 81.3 (+19.6 over BM25), @all 91.0.

Negative results (documented, reproducible): comments field hurts issue-style
queries (-8 net instances) despite its API-search pedigree; fusing history into
the ranking head craters @1 (.463 -> .337); co-change test-bridges are impossible
by construction on repos with 1:1 test:impl coupling (django). The recurring
design law, twice observed: auxiliary channels must be MONOTONE — they may add
candidates, never reorder the lexical head.

Anchor campaign (2026-07-11, evidence-first): file-name anchors measured DEAD
(+2.4pp ceiling — BM25F path field already consumes them); code-block 5-gram
fingerprinting measured DEAD (0/56); definition-symbol anchors measured ALIVE
(25/56 failures have a gold file defining a symbol the issue names). Built with
a rarity gate (symbol defined in ≤3 impl files) and tiered head rights: only
backtick-quoted anchors (strength ≥2.0) may enter the top-10 (cap 2, insert at
rank 8, top-7 sovereign); weaker anchors append at rank 12+. @10 .813→.827,
@all .910→.920, zero @all losses, top-7 invariant 300/300. Config FROZEN after
this change: Lite has served as dev set through five iterations; SWE-bench
Verified is reserved as the untouched held-out test.

Bridge campaign (2026-07-11): the repo is a self-describing system — tests and
docs are NL->code mappings written by the developers. Headroom diagnostics:
test-file lexical bridge (issue matches test vocabulary; test imports gold)
14/52 @10 + 6/24 @all; docs bridge (issue matches doc page; page references
gold) 10/52 + 3/24 after fixing a filter bug that had excluded docs/ from its
own measurement; literal error-string matching 0/52 — modern f-string
interpolation means quoted runtime messages never exist verbatim in source.
Shipped tail-only (positions 14/16, top-10 byte-invariant 300/300): @all
.920->.923. Head-tier test-bridge tried and reverted (-5 net @10: tests import
their subject plus utilities, and import-linkage alone cannot tell them apart).
Ceiling-vs-conversion lesson: a channel that can reach gold must still win its
capped slot against the channel's other candidates — reachability ceilings
(.943) are permissive, conversion (+1) is an intra-channel ranking problem.

## SWE-bench Verified — held-out validation (2026-07-11)

Frozen v7 config, predictions pre-registered in PREDICTIONS.md (commit f5f6b0e)
before the run finished. 500 instances, zero errors.

| subset | n | @1 | @5 | @10 | @all |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **held-out (minus Lite overlap)** | 407 | .354 | .649 | **.794** | **.921** |
| Lite overlap (contaminated) | 93 | .505 | .774 | .817 | .914 |
| full Verified | 500 | .382 | .672 | .798 | .920 |

Recall (.921) matches the dev set (.923) on never-seen instances — the
recall-first architecture generalizes. Head precision (@1/@5) came in below
the pre-registered intervals; the Lite-vs-held-out @1 gap (15pp) confounds
Lite's easier instance selection with dev-set tuning and is reported as
non-transferring. Grep-parity latency, ~8.5k-token bundles, zero learned
parameters throughout.

Post-Verified @1 investigation: BRTracer-style stack-trace boosting (verified
+10pp Top-1 in its home corpus, ICSME 2014) was headroom-measured on Lite
before building: only 17% of issues contain a traceback, gold is in-trace for
just 45% of those (CrashLocator's symptom-vs-cause ceiling, worse here), net
naive @1 bound +5 instances (~+1.7pp) with 3 displacement risks, and zero @10
headroom — below the pre-committed +10-instance build bar. Not built
(diag_stacktrace.py). Conclusion: every non-learned precision-class head
signal is now measured — path anchors (consumed by BM25F), symbol anchors
(shipped, +1.4pp @10), error strings (dead: f-string interpolation), stack
traces (below bar). Head precision beyond @1=.354 held-out requires semantics
that repo mining cannot supply; that boundary is this project's measured edge
of no-learning retrieval.

## SWE-bench Multilingual — zero-shot baseline (2026-07-11)

Frozen v7 pipeline + extension-visibility fix only (no language-specific
engineering beyond existing regexes). First non-LLM localization numbers on
this benchmark. n=300 evaluated (0 harness errors; the 17 lombok instances
that previously errored on a non-UTF-8 byte in `git log` output are now
recovered -- see `errors="replace"` hardening in `history.py`):

| language | n | @5 | @10 | @all |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Java | 43 | .558 | .651 | .767 |
| C | 41 | .732 | .756 | .878 |
| PHP | 43 | .628 | .721 | .791 |
| Go | 41 | .537 | .683 | .780 |
| Rust | 43 | .465 | .628 | .767 |
| JS/TS | 43 | .256 | .535 | .744 |
| Ruby | 44 | .591 | .705 | .795 |
| ALL | 300 | .537 | .663 | .773 |

The language-agnostic lexical core carries .78 all-gold across nine languages.
Tree-sitter priority, from measured gaps: Ruby (no .rb parsing exists at all),
JS/TS (worst @5; re-export-heavy import graphs), Rust (@1 .163). Java and C
nearly match Python with lexical signals alone.

Ruby regex-tier support (2026-07-12): require_relative + lib-root require +
Rails-autoload constant resolution + Ruby def-index. @all .705->.795 (+4/-0);
adding .gemspec/.rake to the corpus initially cost @1 (project-name-dense
metadata outranking code) — fixed with a 0.5 metadata prior; one residual @1
instance (.erb site-template scaffold) accepted rather than tuned away. JS/TS
import-resolution improvements (re-export chains, tsconfig aliases, index
files) measured FLAT on the 43-instance slice — an 11-miss study shows JS/TS
failures are selection-scheduling and monorepo-seeding problems, not parsing
problems; the dominant lever is the per-source additions cap starving pooled
gold files (adaptive selection scheduling queued).

## Region-quality baseline and channel-aware packing (2026-07-11)

Ground truth: the exact lines edited by each gold patch (SWE-bench Lite, 300).
Baseline packing (keyword-coverage only): fix-line recall mean 0.26, median 0.00
— right files, wrong slices; 66% of instances had zero fix-line coverage.
Channel-aware packing v2 (the packer now honors WHY each file was selected:
anchored symbols' definition blocks are packed; deeper allocation to top
evidence files): mean 0.46, median 0.26, +0.4% tokens, file rankings byte-
identical (parity green). On the right-files-found subset: 0.49 / median 0.50.
archex expected_regions (informational, 9 tasks): 0.13 -> 0.19. Note: bgrep-rs
does not yet carry the v2 packing — its parity gate covers file rankings only;
porting + a region-metric gate is queued.

## Neighborhood-first retrieval (2026-07-12, experiment, flag off by default)

For repos >3000 files, seed with rare-term + symbol-anchor hits, expand 2 hops
over import+dir edges (cap 800), rank only within the region (LARGER pattern,
arXiv:2605.16352). Engaged only on babel (16.5k files) in the SWE-bench
Multilingual JS/TS slice: all-gold 2/5 -> 3/5; provably byte-identical on all
38 sub-threshold instances and inert on every Lite repo (max 2.2k files).
Promising but n=5; validation at scale on Multi-SWE-bench's 580 JS/TS
instances (incl. material-ui, 27.6k files) in progress.

## Survival-scheduled packing (2026-07-12, REJECTED — negative result)

Scheduling deep-vs-broad packing by score-concentration confidence (DSpark-inspired
adaptive verification) failed at estimator calibration, exactly as QPP
literature warns: flat class byte-identical (guard worked), peaked class net
-6.5pp with symmetric counts but asymmetric magnitudes — two instances fell
1.0 -> 0.0 when the scheduler confidently deep-packed the wrong files. Score
concentration measures confidence, not correctness. Patch + subset data in
lab/experiments/. Possible salvage (roadmap footnote): gate deep-packing on
anchor-strength signals only (the measured near-certain class), not score
concentration.

## Neighborhood-first at scale (2026-07-12, REJECTED)

Multi-SWE-bench JS/TS validation (580 instances; material-ui = 174 instances at
10.4k files) reversed the babel n=5 result decisively — engaged-group all-gold
43.1% -> 29.9% (+4/-27). Mechanism: the 800-file region cap saturates on every
engaged instance (2-hop expansion from ~15 seeds exceeds it immediately),
making the "neighborhood" a truncation artifact that excludes fix files. The
n=5 babel win was noise; the scale gate worked as designed. Salvage hypotheses
(roadmap, unproven): repo-size-proportional region caps; confidence-filtered
expansion instead of fixed hop/cap truncation. SEPARATE FINDING: 3
sub-threshold svelte instances returned non-identical lists flag-on vs
flag-off (should be inert) — determinism investigation below.

## Assembly-order scheduling (2026-07-12, NULL RESULT)

Global score-ordering of the below-head segment (motivated by Go/JS-TS miss
studies showing pool-ranked candidates starved by guarantee-phase assembly)
moved NOTHING — Go 42 instances and Ruby/JS 87 instances identical at every k,
zero gained/lost, despite 81/87 lists reordering below the head. Conclusion:
membership, not order, binds — the misses sit at pool ranks 21-47, beyond any
reordering's reach. The miss studies located the failures correctly but
misattributed the mechanism. Live levers remain: additions capacity
(Pandora-index roadmap item) and add_score evidence quality. lanes3.py
preserved as the experiment artifact.

## The semantic-channel headroom survey (2026-07-12)

Four imagined channels for the residual gap (within-subsystem discrimination on
NL-only issues), each headroom-measured before building:
- One-bit agent elicitation: oracle +4.0pp @10 (.827->.867); 44% of failures
  are degenerate (right subsystem already — the miss is within-subsystem).
  Verdict: worthwhile v0.3 interface feature, not a breakthrough.
- Hunk-history index (vocabulary time-machine): 5/52 (+~1.7pp) — mechanism
  confirmed (churny short files whose history holds symptom vocabulary),
  coverage narrow.
- Commit-message translation table (repo-native NL->code dictionary): 1/44 —
  translations sane, file-level discrimination negligible.
- Tracker k-NN (prior similar issues' fix-files): NOT DISCRIMINATIVE — control
  files (already retrieved) match prior issues as strongly as missed files at
  every threshold >= 0.30. The repo's own supervision cannot separate a missed
  file from its retrieved siblings. (A tz-comparison bug that let an instance's
  own fix PR leak as "prior" was caught and fixed mid-run.)

Conclusion: the no-learning boundary at @1 .35 / @10 .83 held against every
deterministic channel imagined, including the strongest hypothesis. Remaining
deterministic stack (elicitation + hunks) is worth ~+5pp combined, pending a
stacking measurement. Beyond that: learned semantics or nothing.

## Wave-1 breadth scouting: four territories, three kills, one survivor (2026-07-12)

Territories: rank-aggregation theory, fault localization, recsys cold-start,
MaxEnt/statistical physics (reports in lab/research/wave1/). Diagnostics:
- **CAPS-OFF CEILING**: uncapped evaluation surfaces gold in 98% of failures but at
  median rank 30-70 (tail to 400+), only 31% in any affordably-harvestable
  window, at 4.6x token cost — capacity machinery (TA/NRA/Pandora) killed;
  add_score evidence is the binding constraint. The "fixed caps are the
  villain" arc ends here: caps were hiding an evidence problem, not causing it.
- **PROPAGATION RERANK (RP3beta/heat-kernel sweep)**: headroom only in configs that
  destroy controls (4/52 target at 5/10 control); no differential effect on its
  target class (7.9% siblings vs 7.1% non). Killed.
- **ANCHOR-DISTANCE (SBEST transfer)**: gold top-5 in 19/52 failures, 9/10 control
  — the surviving evidence term; suppressed by incumbent-blends, must enter
  add_score directly. Build in progress.
Also shelved from recsys: stigmergy (per-repo co-access accumulation from agent
sessions) as a v0.3+ product feedback loop — the only signal that grows with use.

## Anchor-distance evidence term (2026-07-12, REJECTED — scale-collapse)

The wave-1 survivor (19/52 top-5 in an 11-doc minicorpus diagnostic) collapsed
to 0/52 @10 conversions when integrated as an additive add_score term and
evaluated in the real ~400-file pool, at every weight 0.3/0.6/1.0
(regression-clean, +1 @all only). Root cause: distance discriminates in a tiny
candidate set but boosts every anchor-adjacent file equally in the full pool,
and dscore∈[0,1] is dominated by add_score's multiplicative bm/fb/pool terms.
METHODOLOGY LESSON: discriminative headroom must be measured at full-pool scale,
not minicorpus scale — the minicorpus diagnostic systematically overstated the
signal. Wave-1 verdict: 0/6 mechanisms cleared (capacity, propagation,
anchor-distance all killed; the theory arc that fixed caps/ordering/proximity
would help is fully falsified). The gap is add_score's evidence quality on files
that share neither vocabulary nor near-graph-distance with the issue — the
genuinely semantic residual.

## Exact function-level metric + refreshed baselines from the shipped engine (2026-07-14)

`parity/region_eval2.py` re-ran all 300 SWE-bench Lite instances against the
shipped `roust-rs` binary (`roust 0.2.0 (c07a09d, clean)`, the engine after
the symbol-name weighting fix), persisting the actual returned region spans
this time (`lab/results_regions/full300_v8.jsonl`). `lab/agentless_metric.py`
now computes an EXACT FUNCTION-level Agentless metric from those spans
(superseding the old `hunk_touched==1.0` proxy) and refreshes FILE/LINE/region-
precision from the same run, so all four numbers come from one engine version
(`lab/results_regions/agentless_metric_v2.json`). Per-instance FILE-level
correctness is byte-identical to the old `full300_final.json` run (277/300
both times) confirming file ranking is unchanged; LINE-level and the new exact
FUNCTION-level came out lower than the old numbers (see root README
Scoreboard) — a real regression in region-packing granularity, not a
measurement artifact, per the diff of `hunk_line_recall` across the two runs.
This does not reopen `lab/`: this directory remains a frozen Python research
sandbox (#8) whose pipelines are not the source of truth for shipped behavior;
the measurement above is driven entirely by the shipped `roust-rs` binary via
`parity/`, same convention as every other post-freeze parity/region_eval run.

## w_name sweep on the exact harness (2026-07-14)

Swept `pack_regions` symbol-name weight `w_name` in {0.0, 0.5, 1.0} on the shipped engine via `parity/region_eval2.py` + `lab/agentless_metric.py` (issue #4): 0.5 and 1.0 tie (weight saturates, LINE 29.3%, line-fraction 0.3989), 0.0 wins (FUNCTION 41.0%, LINE 35.7%, line-fraction 0.4564) — the weighting, validated only on the diverged lab pipeline (#8), was net-negative on the shipped engine and is reverted; winner run `full300_v9.jsonl` (engine d250e1c) → `agentless_metric_v3.json`, losing point `full300_wname05.jsonl` (engine 842f757).

## archex Agentless-metric arm (2026-07-14)

archex 0.19.2, BM25 default mode (no embeddings), `--budget 8192`, measured via `lab/archex_eval/run_archex_metric.py` on all 300 SWE-bench Lite instances (298 ok, 2 timeouts counted as wrong): FILE 56.0% / FUNCTION 38.3% / LINE 25.7% (`lab/results_regions/agentless_metric_archex_bm25.json`); vector/hybrid mode measured below.

## archex vector/hybrid mode measured (2026-07-15)

archex 0.19.2, `--vector` (FastEmbed/ONNX) + `--strategy hybrid`, `--budget 8192`, same protocol as the BM25 run above, all 300 instances (298 ok, 2 timeouts counted as wrong): FILE 57.3% / FUNCTION 40.7% / LINE 27.7% (`lab/results_regions/agentless_metric_archex_vector.json`) — a single-digit gain over BM25 that leaves the ~35-point FILE gap to roust unchanged, and query latency is worse (12.98s median vs BM25's 9.68s) despite a much faster index (0.92s vs 5.69s mean). Steelman complete: the tokenbench agent-loop arm (#1 part (b)) is not justified at current quality.

## Guarded padding + length normalization adopted as engine defaults; re-validated under true isolation (2026-07-16)

`--pad-lines 5 --len-exp 0.85` (comboA from the #4 autopsy campaign) shipped as
`roust-rs`'s own defaults (`73b435e`). Re-validation of this adoption hit an
infra hazard worth recording: `lab/swebench_repos` is a **symlink shared
across every worktree** of this repo, so any two worktrees running the parity
harness or `region_eval2.py` concurrently race `git checkout -f` against the
same physical clones. An earlier nondeterminism claim on `django-13710`
(cold-cache run2 != run3) traced to exactly this — a repro that ran through
the shared symlink during concurrent activity elsewhere, not a genuine engine
bug. Re-tested properly: this worktree's `lab/swebench_repos` was replaced
in-place with a private, exclusively-owned copy (`cp -R` of the shared clones,
integrity-checked afterward — a first copy attempt overlapped with a stray
concurrent `harness.py` run against the shared symlink and was discarded and
redone once that process exited and no eval process was running anywhere).
Under true isolation, zero concurrent eval processes, 3x cold-cache
(`.roust` deleted between runs) `django-13710` repro with the pre-adoption
formula explicit (`--pad-lines 0 --len-exp 1.0`): all three JSON outputs
byte-identical modulo timing fields (`cache: miss` confirmed cold every time,
`engine_sha: 73b435e` / clean). **Verdict: deterministic** — the earlier
report was the shared-symlink race artifact, not an engine defect. (Separately,
`roust-rs/PARITY_NOTES.md` item 15 already fixed one genuine `HashSet`-
iteration-order nondeterminism source in `pack_regions`' `weight()` closure
before this adoption branched; that fix is present here too and is not what
this section is about.)

With isolation established, both binding gates were re-run against the
private repos and PASS: `parity/harness.py --suite lite --gate exact` is
300/300 exact-match, 0 errors (`parity/rust_gate_300_v5.json`) — file ranking
is unchanged by the padding/length-normalization adoption, as the root
README's "Verified — gate confirms" sentence claims. `parity/region_eval2.py`
(no `--pad-lines`/`--len-exp` flags, i.e. the shipped defaults) → the
Agentless metric is FILE 92.33% / FUNCTION 53.33% / LINE 42.67% / mean-fraction
0.51683 (`lab/results_regions/full300_v11.jsonl` →
`lab/results_regions/agentless_metric_v5.json`, also saved as
`agentless_metric_v11.json` for prediction-file-number provenance) —
identical (`all_instances` and `file_correct_subset` blocks byte-for-byte) to
the e-combo worktree's earlier `agentless_metric_combo_p5l085.json`, which
used explicit `--pad-lines 5 --len-exp 0.85` flags against a different engine
commit (`841ef73`) pre-dating this adoption — confirming the "adopt as
defaults" change is behavior-preserving relative to the explicit-flags combo
arm, on top of confirming full cross-isolation reproducibility.

**Follow-up recommended** (not fixed here, out of scope for this adoption):
`lab/swebench_repos` being a symlink shared across every git worktree of this
repo is a standing hazard for any future concurrent parity/region-eval work
— a repo-level fix (e.g. per-worktree private clones, or a lock/queue around
checkouts of the shared clones) should get its own issue.
