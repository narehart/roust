"""Git-history mining for the semantic retrieval layer.

Single `git log` pass over the checked-out repo's recent non-merge commit
history. Produces three signals consumed by lanes2.Corpus / lanes2.select_files:

  msgs      - per-file concatenated commit subjects+bodies (a lightweight
              "commit message field" that often names symbols/behavior a
              patch touches even when the file's own source text doesn't),
              capped to each file's MAX_MSGS_PER_FILE most recent commits.
  cochange  - per-file top co-committed partner files with counts (files
              that historically change together are structurally related
              even absent an import edge), PLUS derived "bridge" edges
              between two production files that both co-change with the
              same test-like file. Production files mostly co-change with
              their OWN test file (which select_files' impl_prior excludes
              from the candidate pool), so direct production<->production
              co-change edges are sparse; a shared test file is evidence
              two production files are related even though they never
              appear together in a commit.
  meta      - per-file {"n_commits", "last_ts", "authors"} summary (not yet
              consumed by any scoring path; mined alongside msgs/cochange
              since it's a free byproduct of the same git-log pass).

No network access, no LLM: this is pure `git log` + string processing.

Parsing note: `git log --pretty=format:__C__%at%x00%an%x00%s%n%b --name-only`
emits, per commit: a sentinel-prefixed header line (author unix timestamp,
author name, subject -- NUL-separated), then the raw body (which may itself
contain blank lines between paragraphs), then a git-inserted blank-line
separator, then the changed-file list (one path per line), then another
blank-line separator (or EOF) before the next commit. Blank lines alone can't
distinguish a body paragraph break from the pre-file-list separator, but the
file list is always the LAST blank-line-delimited block before the next
sentinel/EOF, and (unlike prose) every line in it is a bare path with no
spaces -- so we use "last block, if it parses as bare paths" as the file-list
detector and everything before it as the message body. This resolves the
ambiguity without a second git-log pass.
