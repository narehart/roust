"""The Anthropic tool-use agent loop shared by all four v2 arms.

v1 -> v2 change (see README.md '## Why v2'): retrieval is no longer
INJECTED into the first user message. All four arms get the SAME first
user message (bare issue text) and differ ONLY in which tools are on their
toolbelt:

    A grep        run_command, read_file
    B roust       roust, read_file                  (no grep -- roust is
                                                       THE search tool)
    C roust_grep  roust, run_command, read_file      (agent's choice)
    D rag_grep    rag_search, run_command, read_file (agent's choice)

System prompt, model, max_turns, and temperature are identical across arms
-- that identity is the fairness property this whole benchmark rests on.
The only prompt text that varies by arm is the one-line "your tools are:"
paragraph (which tools exist necessarily differs) and the immediately
following one-sentence opening-move hint; everything else (the stop-early
instruction, the FILES: format, the guardrails) is shared verbatim.

Every request/response is logged to a JSONL transcript for auditability.
Token totals are computed two ways and both are recorded:
  * tiktoken cl100k_base over the actual message text sent/received each
    turn (the headline metric -- tokenizer-neutral, reproducible without an
    API key, comparable 1:1 across arms).
  * the real Anthropic-reported usage.input_tokens/output_tokens (used for
    the $ cost estimate, since that's what billing actually uses).

Additionally (v2, for the fairness audit): every roust/rag_search tool
result's tiktoken length is recorded individually in
`retrieval_tool_tokens`, so summarize.py can report the actual mean tokens
returned per retrieval-tool call, per arm -- auditing whether the ~8192
roust-budget / rag k=24 match actually landed on real repos/queries rather
than trusting the pre-run calibration in rag_tool.py.
