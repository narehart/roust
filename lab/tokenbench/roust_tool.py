"""Condition B/C: roust exposed as an agent-callable TOOL, not injected
context. This is the core v1->v2 fix -- see README.md '## Why v2' for the
injection-billing bug this replaces.

The agent calls roust(query) with a query of ITS OWN CHOOSING (not
necessarily the raw issue text -- the agent can refine, e.g. narrow to an
error string or symbol name after an initial miss). Each call shells out to
the real CLI:

    uv run roust --json --budget 8192 "<query>" <repo>

invoked with cwd=<roust repo root> so `uv run` resolves the project's own
environment regardless of what venv the tokenbench harness itself runs
under. Returns the packed bundle text as the tool result -- exactly what a
real integration would see -- and nothing else is added to the
conversation on the agent's behalf.
