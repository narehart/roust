"""On-disk index cache for roust, stored under ``<repo>/.roust/``.

Corpus construction (a full file walk + read + tokenize pass over every
candidate file in the repo) is the expensive part of a roust run; this module
caches that work (plus the import graph and, optionally, mined git history)
keyed on:

  - the repo's git HEAD sha (``git rev-parse HEAD``; ``"nogit"`` if the path
    isn't a git repo at all), and
  - the ``with_history``/``with_docs`` flags a query was run with.

Unlike keying on a hash of every file's stat (which forces a full rebuild on
ANY change, however small), the cache instead stores a manifest --
``{relpath: (mtime_ns, size)}`` for every candidate-extension file (code, plus
docs extensions when ``with_docs``) -- alongside the pickled Corpus. On load,
a fresh stat-only walk is diffed against that manifest to classify the
working tree since the cache was written:

  - unchanged: no work at all, the cached Corpus is returned as-is.
  - modified only (the common agent edit-loop case: existing files' content
    changed, nothing added or removed): the cached Corpus is PATCHED in
    place -- each modified file's old contributions are subtracted and its
    new contributions added back (Corpus.update_files / update_docs_files),
    and the import graph is repaired for just the files that changed
    (update_import_graph_for_files) -- instead of rebuilding from scratch.
  - HEAD moved, or any file was added/removed: a conservative FULL REBUILD.
    Module-index prefix resolution and import edges can shift globally when
    the file SET changes (a new file can shadow/absorb an existing module
    prefix, a removed file can orphan edges elsewhere), so add/remove is
    deliberately not special-cased the way pure content edits are.

A successful incremental patch is designed to be byte-for-byte
observationally identical to a fresh build over the same on-disk content
(same corpus.bm25/select_files output for any query) -- see the docstrings
on Corpus.update_files / update_import_graph_for_files in roust.core for the
subtract-then-add invariant this relies on. If a patch attempt turns out to
be shaped like an add/remove after all (e.g. an edit shrinks a file below
MAX_FILE_BYTES's oversized-exclusion threshold, or empties it out entirely),
Corpus.update_files/update_docs_files decline (returning False, having made
NO changes) and the caller falls back to a full rebuild.

The pickle also carries an explicit ``CACHE_VERSION``; bumping it invalidates
every existing cache file regardless of key match, for use whenever the
pickled shape (Corpus's attributes, the edges type, the history tuple shape,
the manifest schema) changes in a way that would make an old pickle unsafe to
unpickle into the current code. ``roust.core.Corpus`` unconditionally
excludes ``.roust/`` from its own file walk, so this cache directory is never
itself indexed.
